    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another, often with the aim of improving efficiency, security, or compatibility. In the context of data science, encoding is crucial for preparing and transforming data so that it can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms. Different types of encoding techniques are used based on the nature of the data and the requirements of the analysis or modeling task.\n",

    "Data encoding in data science serves several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data Handling: Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, and data encoding is often used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.\n",

    "Feature Engineering: Encoding can be part of feature engineering, where the goal is to create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the performance of machine learning models.\n",
